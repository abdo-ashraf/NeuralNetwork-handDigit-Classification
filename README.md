# NeuralNetwork-handDigit-Classification
1. import data
2. data was clean so no need for cleaning step
3. then for binary classification i tried 3 dense layers network that give me pretty good accuracy
4. then for Multiclass classification i tried bigger pure dense layers network that give me little poor accuracy
5. so i tried LeNet-5 that give so good performance with 100% accuracy for train set and ~99% accuracy for test set
