# NeuralNetwork-handDigit-Classification
first import data
data was clean so no need for cleaning step
then for binary classification i tried 3 dense layers network that give me pretty good accuracy
then for Multiclass classification i tried bigger pure dense layers network that give me little poor accuracy
so i tried LeNet-5 that give so good performance with 100% accuracy for train set and ~99% accuracy for test set
